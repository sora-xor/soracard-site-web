    "note": "* Usage fees are necessary to cover the costs of banking and card service partners, who handle financial transactions. These fees are a financially sustainable way for SORA to provide its services while ensuring the privacy and security of users. It's important to remember that if a product is free, you are likely the product being sold. With SORA, you can trust that your personal information is not being used for profit. So, paying the usage fees is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with using a secure and reliable platform like SORA Card."
