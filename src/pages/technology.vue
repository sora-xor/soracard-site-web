      SORA is built on <a href="https://substrate.io/" target="_blank">Parity Substrate</a>, a framework that scales
      more
      efficiently than
      Ethereum, resulting in lower fees. With SORA's NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) mechanism, validators play a
      crucial
      role in accepting or rejecting transactions.

      pallet offers seamless interoperability between the entire <a href="https://polkadot.network/"
        target="_blank">Polkadot</a> and <a href="https://kusama.network/" target="_blank">Kusama</a> ecosystems, paving
      the way for direct and secure interactions between
      networks.
