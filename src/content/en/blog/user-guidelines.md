# **SORA Card User Guidelines**
**SORA Card is live and ready to be used!**

We invite all early adopters—people who successfully passed KYC before July 2024—to follow the steps below before using their account and card:

**1. Early adopters: Request new IBAN before ordering a card**

**Note: The issuer will soon disable the initially issued IBANs**. To use SORA Card with all its features, please add a new account and order your SORA Card from this account.

This is complementary.

**If you doubt about being an early adopter:**

In case you can order a virtual card from your IBAN, you should do that. It means you are not considered an early adopter and you do not need to add a new account before ordering your virtual card.

Additionally, when adding a new account next to your initial IBAN, the fee should be 0 for early adopters.

If you are requested to pay a fee of €2.50 to add a new account you do not need to add a new account to order your virtual card. If you are in the latter situation, you can order a SORA Card from the initial account free of charge.

**How to do it:**

* Go to Settings > Add accounts.

* Click on New > Select Consumer account and confirm

**2. Order your card from the new IBAN**

Early adopters should order their virtual card from the new IBAN account.

New users can order their virtual cards from the issued IBAN.

Go to your new account and click the red ‘Order’ button to order a card.

Next: slide to confirm your details and the fee-your first card is free of charge.

Your virtual card will be issued in seconds.

Congratulations!

You now have your virtual SORA Card. To spend your IBAN funds, top up your new card.

**3. For all users: Loading your card**

Click on your card in the app.

Then, click on the 'Load' button.
