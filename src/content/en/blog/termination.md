The termination is conducted **in accordance with the SORA Card Terms and Conditions** and the applicable card-issuing and processing framework, including the rules of **Unlimit**.

1. Legal basis, Notice period, and Termination Timeline

2. Mobile App Service Cut-Off

3. Issuer-level account suspensions by Unlimit

---

## **1. Legal Basis, Notice Period, and Termination Timeline**

Pursuant to the SORA Card Terms and the applicable Unlimit card program rules:

- The SORA Card service may be **terminated with notice**, or **with immediate effect where required for regulatory, compliance, or operational reasons**.
- During the wind-down phase, **certain services, features, or accounts may be restricted, suspended, or disabled earlier** than the final termination date.

---

## **2. Mobile App Service Cut-Off (Critical)**

⚠️ **Important Deadline**

**The SORA Card mobile application and all card-related functionality will cease to be available after Friday, 30 January 2026 at 18:00 (6:00 PM) GMT.**

After this time:

- The SORA Card app **will no longer provide access** to card balances, transactions, or account actions
- No withdrawals, card actions, or balance interactions will be possible via the app
- Any remaining access to funds **will not be available through SORA Card or the mobile application**

👉 **After the cut-off, the only way to access or request remaining card balances is by contacting Unlimit directly.**

---

## **3. Issuer-Level Account Suspensions by Unlimit**

Please note the following important distinction:

- **Some SORA Card accounts are currently suspended directly by the issuer, Unlimit**, under its regulatory, compliance, and risk management obligations.
- These suspensions are **issuer-level actions**, outside the operational control of SORA Card, SORA Biome, or application partners.
- Suspended accounts may still show balances but remain **temporarily inaccessible** pending issuer review or release.

### **SORA Biome Actions**

**SORA Biome is actively engaging with Unlimit** at program level to **push for the release of balances** on suspended accounts wherever legally and operationally possible.

However:

- **Only Unlimit has the authority to release funds or lift suspensions**
- Users must therefore **act directly with Unlimit** to request access to any remaining balances

---

## **4. User Guide: How to Request Release of Funds from Unlimit**

If your account is suspended or shows a remaining balance after the app cut-off, please follow these steps:

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Prepare Your Details**
    - Full legal name
    - Email address registered with SORA Card
    - Cardholder ID or last 4 digits of your card (if available)
    - Screenshot or record of remaining balance (if accessible before cut-off)
2. **Contact Unlimit Directly**
    - Use Unlimit’s official support or compliance contact channels
    - State clearly that you are a **SORA Card cardholder requesting release of remaining funds**
3. **Request Explicitly**
    - Ask for:
        - The **reason for the suspension**, and
        - The **procedure to withdraw or release your remaining balance**
4. **Complete Compliance Requests**
    - Unlimit may request additional KYC or documentation
    - Prompt responses will help avoid delays
5. **Escalate if Needed**
    - Request escalation to Unlimit’s **compliance or card program team** if no response is received within a reasonable timeframe
    - Retain copies of all correspondence

📌 *Important:* Neither SORA Card nor SORA Biome can submit individual balance release requests on behalf of users.

---

## **5. Required User Action – Withdrawal of Crypto Assets (GateHub)**

All users are **strongly requested to withdraw all crypto assets** held in **GateHub wallets accessed via the SORA Card app** **before the app cut-off**.

- GateHub services are provided by a **third-party provider**
- These services will be discontinued as part of the SORA Card shutdown
- Assets not withdrawn in time **may become inaccessible**

📌 **Additional details on supported assets and withdrawal instructions will follow.**

---

## **6. Important Clarification: SORA Wallet Continues to Operate**

To avoid any ambiguity:

**The SORA Wallet — the self-custodial, non-custodial crypto wallet — will continue to remain operational and functional until further notice.**

- The SORA Wallet is **independent of the SORA Card program**
- Users retain **full control of their private keys**
- The termination of the SORA Card **does not affect the SORA Wallet software**

**SORA lives on.**

This transition impacts **card and issuer-related services only**, not the broader SORA ecosystem.

---

## **7. Recent Applicants – No Account Allocation**

Please note:

- Applicants who completed onboarding but **were not allocated a SORA Card account will not receive one**
- As **no account was opened**, **no funds were held**, and **no fees or costs are associated** with the termination
- No action is required from these applicants

---

## **8. Final Remarks**

We understand the disruption caused by the termination and issuer-level suspensions and confirm that **SORA Biome continues to advocate for users at program level**.

Please ensure you **take all required actions before**

**Friday, 30 January 2026 at 18:00 GMT**, and contact Unlimit directly thereafter where applicable.

Sincerely,

**The SORA Card Team**

**In cooperation with SORA Biome, Unlimit, and Hoppacard**
