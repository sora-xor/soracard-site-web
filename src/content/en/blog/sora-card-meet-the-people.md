### Mathieu and Beno, part of the management team behind the SORA Card initiative

As we draw closer to the registration and KYC release for SORA Card, we had a chat with two people who are actively contributing to the integration and realization of the SORA Card fiat banking wallet into the open-source decentralized SORA Wallet and the Polkaswap DEX.

**Beno** from SORA Biome is contributing to the delivery of SORA Card to the SORA Community.
