## Ordering SORA Card

There are two channels to apply for SORA Card:

1. On the polkaswap.io dApp
2. Through the SORA Wallet mobile app (available on Google Play and the Apple App Store — if you just downloaded SORA Wallet, make sure to store your seed phrase safely)

And the three options to apply for SORA Card, along with the fees for each option are:

1. If you already have more than €100 worth of XOR in your account: the application with your SORA address is free
2. If you want to purchase XOR to have the €100 balance for a free account, you can buy XOR worth up to €700 within the app with only soft KYC required (details below)
3. If you do not have €100 worth of XOR and you don’t want to purchase it, there will be a fee of €20 to apply for KYC and the SORA Card. This payment can be made with any debit/credit card (supported cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diners Club, JCB)
